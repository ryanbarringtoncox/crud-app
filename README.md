## CRUD

This is an excercise in web dev and a work in progress.  I wanted to build something from scratch using React, Redux, Django and Webpack.

CRUD stands for:

  - *Create* people with names, jobs (for now).
  - *Read* people, list in GUI.
  - *Update/Edit* people through form.
  - *Delete* people.


### Frontend

` cd frontend/`
` npm install`

Installs frontend deps in node_modules dir.

` yarn start`

Runs the frontend app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### TODOs:
  - clean up front end code (function names, etc)
  - add django backend with models, sqlite
  - style it
  - add client-side validation
  - add server-side validation
  - add clients model in db, with proper associations
  - add clients to frontend, make it useable and easy
  - switch to Django rest API?
  - look into security
